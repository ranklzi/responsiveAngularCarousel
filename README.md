responsiveAngularCarousel
=========================
You can see an example for consuming the angular responsive carousel in file 'index.html'.

This project relies on Twitter Bootstrap 3 and Jquery.

How to consume:
&lt;ul rn-carousel-responsive carousel-items="items"&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;


Limitations of initial version: 
1) Each item in the array bounded to 'carousel-items' is expected to have an 'imageUrl' property.
